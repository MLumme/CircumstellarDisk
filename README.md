Old piece of code for radiative transfer course usin python2.7, is horribly slow due to lack of parallelization, and less than stellar implementation of photon packet tracing. Might at some point rework it for the sake of training, as its output is bit suspect in some regards. Also, error messges during output are not exactly what one would call good coding practices, nevermind rest of the code, which is abosolutely horrible monolithic chunck of code. 

Disk model is from a paper by Peest et al (2017), chapter 5.2, see below for proper reference.
