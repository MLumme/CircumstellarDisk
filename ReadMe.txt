In order the input parameters from input.txt, again, and expected units
 Domain cells in radial direction
 Domain cells in height direction
 domain cells in azimuthal direction
 
 Inner radius of dust containing domain R_min; AU
 Outer radius of dust containing domain R_max; AU
 Heigth of domain; AU

 Scale radius of disk model h_0; AU
 Scale height of disk model R_0; AU
 Disk mass; M_sun
 Opacity of dust; cm**2/g
 single scattering albedo

 Spectral luminosity of the star; W/Hz
 Number of photon packets
 Wavelengt of the photons; micron

 Inclination of observer measured from system pole; deg
 length of the detector side, field will always cover a (2.2R_max x 2.2R_max) area spatially 

Whe run give name of output image as command line arguments, outputs scattered light image,
shows same plot, prints out total numeber of errors, and number of packets for which forced firxt scatter is ignored due to low optical depth along path.
